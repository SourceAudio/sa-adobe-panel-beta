# SourceAudio Adobe Panel Beta
Welcome to the testing beta for our new Adobe Panel! This started as a small project that has gained a lot of traction, and we're excited to get in front of new testers!
 
> **Disclaimer**: While this says "beta", it's an alpha. There will be things that might not work. If you find one, please make an issue!
 
## Requirements
- Windows 
  - Mac version to come soon
- Adobe Premiere CC 2017
  - Audition version to come soon
- A SourceAudio Account
- Experience as a SourceAudio user
  - This test is meant for people that already know how to use SourceAudio. This is not a good entry point for new users, yet.

## Installation
- Install Adobe Premiere CC 2017
- Make sure Premiere is closed
- Download and install the ZXP Installer from http://zxpinstaller.com/
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/SourceAudio/sa-adobe-panel-beta/blob/master/SourceAudioAdobePanel_A12.zxp)
- Use the ZXP Installer to install the `SourceAudioAdobePanel_A12.zxp` file. (Drag and drop is finicky, just browse select it)
- Start Premiere, and go to `Window > Extensions > SourceAudio`
- Profit!
