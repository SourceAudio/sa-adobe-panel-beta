# SourceAudio Adobe Panel Beta
> **Current Version**: [A22](https://github.com/SourceAudio/sa-adobe-panel-beta/releases)

Welcome to the testing beta for our new Adobe Panel! This started as a small project that has gained a lot of traction, and we're excited to get in front of new testers!
 
> **Disclaimer**: While the repo says "beta", it's technically closer to an alpha. There will be things that might not work. If you find one, please make an issue!
 
## Requirements
- Windows or OSX
- Adobe Premiere CC 2017 or 2018
- A SourceAudio Account
- Experience as a SourceAudio user
  - This test is meant for people that already know how to use SourceAudio. This is not a good entry point for new users... yet.

## Installation
1. Install Adobe Premiere CC
2. Make sure Premiere is closed
3. Download and install the ZXP Installer from http://zxpinstaller.com/
4. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/SourceAudio/sa-adobe-panel-beta/releases)
5. Use the ZXP Installer to install the `SourceAudioAdobePanel_AXX.zxp` file. (Drag and drop is finicky, just browse select it)
6. Start Premiere, and go to `Window > Extensions > SourceAudio`
7. Profit!
 
## Features
- **Drag and Drop**: Any time you see a track inside the panel, you can click and drag it directly into your timeline. The panel will automatically download and update the placement when it's done. You can also select multiple tracks and drag them all.
- **Manage Received Tracks**:
 You can see all the tracks you've been sent in one quick list in the panel. Ideal for editors who need a quick reference to tracks sent by their Music Supervisor.
- **Site Search**: Search all the sites your account is connected to and filter by SFX to quickly find tracks to add to your project.
- **Playlists**: View and manage your playlists from inside Premiere.
- **Cuesheet Export**: Instantly save your audio timeline into a RapidCue formatted cuesheet, complete with any metadata your tracks had entered into SourceAudio.
- **Dynamic Lists**: Easily reference recently played with our dynamic history list.
- **Automatic Organization**: Easily have added tracks added to paths relative to your project folder, or a specific folder of your choosing.

## FAQ
- **My panel crashed or something unexpected happened! What do I do?**  
  *Please* make an issue in this repo with as much detail as you can. If you're comfortable with this sort of thing, head to http://localhost:7778/ select the panel, and then take a screenshot of the most recent logs in there and include it in your report.
- **How do I change my settings?**  
  In the bottom-left corner of the panel is a cog menu that has your options to change the site you're currently in, settings, and log out.
- **I have a buddy that wants to test out the panel, can I share it with them?**  
  Sure! Please ensure they understand this is still in the testing phase, and that they meet the requirements above.
- **Can you add my very special feature into the panel?**  
  Mayyyyyybe. Make an issue with your request, detailing the feature and why you think it'd be useful.
- **How will I know when a new version comes out?**  
  For the moment, check back here. I'll add some auto-notification from the panel itself in a future release.
- **Can I use this in production?**  
  I wouldn't recommend it, but I'm not your mom.
